# Movie Box

In this project you see a list of some popular movies.
When you click on each movie, you get the details of that.

## Installation

First of all you need to add packages,I've been added to this project:

```bash
yarn add;
```

Then if you like, you can run the project by [parcel](https://parceljs.org/)

```bash
yarn add --dev parcel;
yarn parcel index.html
```
